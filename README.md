# React-Redux Setup

This React-Redux setup is a project I am creating to serve as a template for all my React and Redux based projects. Any one who wishes to use this template is free to use it as it is free and open to anyone. Also, you may want to share and improve on the basic setup that I have done feel free to fork the project.

Enjoy!

## Built With

- CRA
- stylelint for CSS
- Eslint for Javascript
- React Testing Library for unit tests of the components
- React router to handle multiple rendering of your applications
- Redux for state management
- React-redux to connect your React components to the Redux store
- redux-thunk a middleware that allows you to call actions creators that return a function instead of an action object
